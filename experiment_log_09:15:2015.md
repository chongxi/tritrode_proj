####1 Patch one cell while using broken glass electrode to do  local field recording


```
This is the test case to verify that our single amplifier recording system is good.
That we can both get whole cell recording and its extracellular recording from 2 CV-7B head-stage in the 700B amp. 
```

**Equipment**: *1* 700B + *2* CV-7B

**Ground connection**: one CV-7B + purfusion system is common grounded with bath ground, which is float.
